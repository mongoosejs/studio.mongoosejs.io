## New Document Detail Page

Our `/model/:modelName/document/:id` page has a new look! We added search and data type filter bar for quick navigation through large documents, and made collapsible sections for better readability for documents with large fields.

We also added **toggleable view modes** to the document detail page to switch between viewing fields and viewing the document as JSON.

Oh and you can now also add custom fields to your documents.

## Fixed Export With Query Selectors

In v0.0.127 we found a bug where exporting documents used Mongoose's [`sanitizeFilter` option](https://thecodebarbarian.com/whats-new-in-mongoose-6-sanitizefilter.html), which prevented exporting query results with query selectors.
You can now export any query result, including those with query selectors.

## Edit Team Member Roles

Before v0.0.128, you could only set a team member's role when you originally invited them to your team.
There was no way to change a team member's role after they were added to your team.
Now, workspace owners and admins can edit team member roles from the Team page.
