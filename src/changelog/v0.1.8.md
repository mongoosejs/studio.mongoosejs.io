🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 3! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Claude Support: Now chat with Anthropic models in Studio!

We're excited to announce that Mongoose Studio now speaks Claude! You can power your conversations with Anthropic's Claude models directly from the Chat tab—simply provide your Anthropic API key and pick from all available Claude models, like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Opus, and Haiku.

Whether you're troubleshooting queries, generating Mongoose scripts, or brainstorming database designs, you can now choose from both OpenAI *and* Anthropic for your workflow. Switch seamlessly between OpenAI GPT-4o and Claude models—no restarts or configuration headaches needed.

Anthropic models come with unique strengths in reasoning and code explanations, so you can get smarter, more relevant assistance for your MongoDB & Mongoose tasks. Just drop in your key in settings, select your preferred model, and chat away. Enjoy even more flexibility as you build with Mongoose Studio!

```javascript
app.use('/studio', await studio(
  null,
  conn,
  {
    //model: 'gpt-4.1-nano',
    //openAIAPIKey: 'sk-proj-XYZ',
    anthropicAPIKey: 'sk-ant-api-XYZ' // <-- NEW!
  })
);
```
