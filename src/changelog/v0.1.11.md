🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 5! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Real-time LLM Streaming in Chat

Chat in Mongoose Studio just leveled up with live-streamed AI responses powered by Vercel's AI SDK! Our new *Stream Chat Message* feature delivers answers word-by-word as they’re generated, so you're never left waiting for a full response.

Whether you use OpenAI, Anthropic, or the inbuilt Mongoose Studio assistant, context-aware, streaming output means more natural conversations and less delay. Massive reduction in amount of time spent staring at loading spinners.
