🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar begins! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Linked Document References in JSON View

You can now directly navigate between related documents when viewing JSON data on your document pages! For any fields that reference another model, you'll see a "View Document" link next to the JSON value. Clicking it will instantly take you to that document's detail page for seamless browsing of linked data.

Other improvements:
- The JSON viewer is now more modular and easier to maintain for future enhancements.
- Collapsed and filter views continue to work as before, with reference links available wherever relevant.

This update makes it much easier to explore and understand relationships in your data!

## Smarter Freshness for Dashboard Results

Tired of stale insights? Now, dashboard results stay up to date without manual refreshes! 🎉

Whenever you open a dashboard, Mongoose Studio will automatically refresh its results if:
- No results exist yet, or
- The most recent results are over 6 hours old.

This ensures everyone always sees timely data while reducing unnecessary recalculations. Enjoy more accurate analytics, zero hassle.
