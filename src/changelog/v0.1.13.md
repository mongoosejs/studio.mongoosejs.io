🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 7! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Editting Dashboards via Chat

The dashboard view now has a "Start Chat" option that starts a new chat based on that dashboard.

You can use this to easily edit existing dashboards, from basic tasks like updating colors to more sophisticated tasks like adding new elements.
Iterate on your dashboard in the chat tab, and then click "Overwrite Dashboard" to update your dashboard.
