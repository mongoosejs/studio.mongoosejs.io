🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 21! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement.

## Added support for array of refs in JSON view

Mongoose Studio can now detect and correctly link to references that are represented as arrays, not just single ref fields. In previous versions, reference links would only appear for properties where the value was a single ObjectId. With this change, arrays of refs are handled by extracting references even from nested or array schema paths, making each referenced document accessible via a link in the JSON tree.
