## Map view for GeoJSON fields

Mongoose Studio now includes a **Map** view for models that have GeoJSON fields. Studio automatically detects GeoJSON-style fields (objects with `type` and `coordinates`), lets you pick which field to visualize, and renders the loaded documents on an interactive map.

Click a marker/shape to open a popup with a link straight to that document.

## Edit GeoJSON points & polygons in Document Details

You can now edit GeoJSON geometries directly from the Document Details view, including **Point** and **Polygon** data. This makes it much easier to fix coordinates, redraw shapes, and validate what you’re saving without leaving Mongoose Studio.
