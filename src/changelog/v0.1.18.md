🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 18! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Collection Info Modal

We've introduced a new "Collection Info" modal accessible from the models list via an improved actions menu ("...")—replacing the old inline Indexes button. The new modal displays key collection statistics for the current MongoDB model, including document count, index count, total index size, total storage size, collation details, and if the collection is capped.

This update provides a concise and accessible overview of your collection's characteristics and storage, similar to what MongoDB Atlas displays.
