🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 17! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## New Array UI

No more plain JSON arrays in the document detail view.
Arrays are now collapsed to the first 3 items by default, and can be expanded to view all items.
For large arrays, see a preview up front, plus a one-click option to display every item.

The UI also has index badges for each item, making it easy to identify and navigate through the array; and no more curly braces between items cluttering the view.

## Highlight & Search for Virtuals

You can now highlight and search for virtual fields in the document viewer. As you type in the search box, matching virtuals and schema fields are shown up top—highlighted for quick scanning—while unmatched fields collapse to the bottom. Virtuals even get their own special highlighting and always-visible headers, making it easy to spot and drill into computed fields at a glance.
