🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 2! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Contextual Autocomplete Improvements### Smarter Contextual Autocomplete

Autocomplete just got a lot more intelligent! Field and operator suggestions are now context-aware: when you’re typing after a colon (like in `{ age: | }`), you’ll get a list of all valid MongoDB operators; when you’re starting a key, autocomplete suggests only schema field names. This means you’ll see only the most relevant suggestions as you build queries, dramatically speeding up your workflow and reducing mistakes.

### Autocomplete for 1-Level Deep Nested Fields

You can now get autocomplete for nested field names one level deep—just type something like `address.` and you’ll see all subfields available under `address`, such as `address.city` and `address.zip`. This makes working with embedded documents and subdocuments a breeze, so you can discover your data structure instantly without leaving the editor.
