🎄 Mongoose Studio Advent Calendar Day 4! 🎁

Every day from Dec 1 → Dec 25, I’m shipping a new Mongoose Studio feature or improvement… all leading up to a big v1.0.0 release.

## Full Screen Maps in Chat Tab

Viewing map results just got a big upgrade! Maps are now beautifully rendered fullscreen right inside the chat tab—making it effortless to explore and analyze geospatial data without leaving your conversation. Whether you’re visualizing locations, routes, or custom feature collections, maps automatically adapt to the available space and look great at any size. It’s a smoother, more immersive way to see your data in context—try it out on your next geo query!
